 ## 👋 Greetings

My name is Pavel and I am novice programmer.

⭐ My *area of interest* is backend development, computer graphics and low-level stuff.

🔍 Right now *I am focused on learning* `C/C++`. I also have some minor experience writing `Python`, `bash` and `Nix`.

❤️ Never heard of `Nix` before? It is configuration language of `Nix` package manager and `NixOS` linux distribution. [*I am big fan of these two!*](https://github.com/jys1670/nixos-config) 

💬 I *speak* `English` (upper-intermediate) and `Russian` (native).



## 📝 My (not too embarrassing) pet projects

* [**DataScience**](https://github.com/jys1670/DataScienceProjects) —  PyTorch stuff such as customer churn prediction, human face generator, manga colorizer, etc. Please note that all descriptions are in Russian.
* [**Transport Catalogue**](https://github.com/jys1670/cpp-transport-catalogue) — simplistic C++ navigator, capable of looking for the fastest path and drawing a map.
* [**Spreadsheet**](https://github.com/jys1670/spreadsheet) — table with text and formula cells, an attempt to replicate core features of the Microsoft Excel.
* [**Mini-python**](https://github.com/jys1670/mini-python) — primitive interpreter created for a general understanding of ideas behind domain-specific languages (DSL).
